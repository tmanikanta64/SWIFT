# swift

* swift is a compiled programming language.
* swift is desighned by chris lattner.
* It was developed by Apple Inc for macOS,iOS,watchOS,tvOS,LinuX.
* code written at global scope is used as the entry point for the program,so we no need to use a main function.
* In swift we no need to write semicolons at the end of every statement.

### simple values

* Use let to make a constant and var to make a variable.

```swift
var myVariable = 4
myVariable = 16
let myConstant = 8
```

* A Constant or a variable must have the same type as the value you want to assign to it.
* However,you don't always have to write the explicitly.

* Providing a value when you create a constant or variable lets the compiler infer its type. In the example above, the   
   compiler infers that myVariable is an integer because its initial value is a integer.
* If the initial value doesnâ€™t provide enough information (or if there is no initial value), specify the type by writing 
   it after the variable, separated by a colon.
```swift
    let myVariable : double = 20.5
```
