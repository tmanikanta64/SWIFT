# swift
* swift is a compiled programming language.
* swift is desighned by chris lattner.
* It was developed by Apple Inc for macOS,iOS,watchOS,tvOS,LinuX.
* code written at global scope is used as the entry point for the program,so we no need to use a main function.
* In swift we no need to write semicolons at the end of every statement.
### simple values
* Use let to make a constant and var to make a variable.
```var myVariable = 4
   myVariable = 16
   let myConstant = 8
   ```
* A Constant or a variable must have the same type as the value you want to assign to it.
* However,you don't always have to write the explicitly.
